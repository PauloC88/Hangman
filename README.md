Wellcode - My fifth project
### Hangman game rules
One player thinks of a word (of minimum 4 and maximum 15 letters). The second player tries to guess the word, one letter at a time. The second player is entitled to a maximum of 6 unsuccessful attempts to guess a letter.  
If the second player doesn't guess the word, the first player wins.
